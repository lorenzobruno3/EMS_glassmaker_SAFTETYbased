# EMS_glassmaker_SAFTETYbased
Optimisation based on EMS approach with data from Steklarna with SAFETY bases. 

The point is that we added 
- the dataset annually for STEKLARNA with 15 min timestep
- SAFETY is integrated only for TANK unit
- the UHI is normalized based on CAPEX in the cost function (in terms of costs)
-
